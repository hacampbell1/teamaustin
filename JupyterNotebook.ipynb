    "From Box Office Mojo, 3387 records of films during the years 2010-2018, studio name, and their corresponding domestic and foreign gross box-office revenue are given.The Box Office Mojo data type accuratley described the string data as object. However, foreign gross total was listed as \"object\" and domestic gross was listed as a float even though no decimal value was indicated. Cleaning the dataset included changing the data type of foreign and domestic gross to integer. There were less than 40 NaNs between the studio, and domestic gross columns so dropping these rows was applicable. Alternatively, with over 1,300 NaN values under foreign gross column, the missing data was too significant to draw conclusions and limited analysis. The team concurred that replacing such NaNs with the related mean or another significant value would disproportionaly skew the data. As a result, the team utilized the .describe and .info methods to return the following descriptive statistics for only domestic gross:"

The 12 column headers provided data for each films': synopsis, rating, genre, director, writer, release date, dvd date, box office revenue, run time, and studio. Every column had NaN values, excluding id. The most significant NaN columns were currency, box office, and studio, each with less than 350 records. This means 78% of the data for each of these columns is missing. The currency value was either USD ($) or NaN. Without data on the release location of each film, the team was unable to substitute the missing currencies. Similarly, with such a deficit of data points for box office revenue amounts, filling in mean or similar profit values would disrupt the accuracy of the dataset significantly. Genre was analyzed within a separate dataset, and therefore remained untouched. Theater date and dvd date were converted using Python's datetime module. "

    "From Box Office Mojo, 3387 records of films during the years 2010-2018, studio name, and their corresponding domestic and foreign gross box-office revenue are given.The Box Office Mojo data type accuratley described the string data as object. However, foreign gross total was listed as \"object\" and domestic gross was listed as a float even though no decimal value was indicated.Cleaning the dataset included changing the data type of foreign and domestic gross to integer. There were less than 40 NaNs between the studio, and domestic gross columns so dropping these rows was applicable. ALternatively, with over 1,300 NaN values under foreign gross column, the missing data was too significant to draw conclusions and limited analysis. The team concurred that replacing such NaNs with the related mean or another significant value would disproportionaly skew the data. After this, the team utilized the .describe and .info methods to return the following descriptive statistics:"
